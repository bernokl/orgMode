* Using tmux
** Lifting text using tmux
In tmux, copy-mode allows you to temporarily halt the operation of the terminal so that you can move through the text that has been sent to the terminal.

You can move around text in the terminal using standard emacs movement keys C-a C-e M-f, arrow keys PgUp PgDn
You can follow the sequence in the table below to copy text from the tmux buffer and
paste it else where.
